Design and Implementation of a Level-1 Cache SimulatorDesign and Implementation of a Level-1 Cache Simulator

- Designed and implemented an L-1 cache simulator.
- The simulated cache used the LRU replacement policy.
- Also wrote a small tool that generated a trace file with the sequence of memory operations triggered by a matrix multiplication code operating on given matrices.
- Analyzed the performance based on different configurations like cache size, cache block size, cache associativity, and write hit and miss policies.





Cycle-accurate Simulator of 5-Stage MIPS like pipelines processorCycle-accurate Simulator of 5-Stage MIPS like pipelines processor

- Designed and implemented a C++ cycle-accurate simulator of a 5-stage MIPS-like pipelined processor.
- The simulator included handling of data, control and structural hazards.
- The simulator handled both integer and floating-point functional units with different latencies



Design and implementation of a C++ cycle-accurate simulator of a dynamically scheduled processor implementing the Tomasulo algorithm with Reorder Buffer.Design and implementation of a C++ cycle-accurate simulator of a dynamically scheduled processor implementing the Tomasulo algorithm with Reorder Buffer.

-Created the simulator for implementation of the Tomasulo algorithm and analysis of the algorithm

-Implemented load bypassing and store bypassing in the design to optimize clock cycle

-Used cyclic buffer to implement the reorder buffer
